/**
 *
 * All styling should first be done as SASS and then compiled into CSS.
 * The following dependencies should be present at compile time
 *  - breakpoint (todo: verify name!)
 *  - singularitygs
 * For more information using SASS use google, it is recommended to use compass!
 *
 * You should have the following gems installed
 * gem install compass
 * gem install singularitygs
 * gem install breakpoint
 *
 * We have split our source up into several logical places in order to
 * lower inter-dependencies and increase reusability.
 *
 * _colors - All colors should be defined here and referenced through the rest.
 * _mixins - Reusable functions like size calculation, transitions etc.
 * _navigation - All general menu related.
 * _layout - Top level layout, more specific should be in sub-files.
 * _node-<bundle> - all specific styling for that node bundle.
 *
 * If for some reason it makes sense to split it out into a new file say
 * we have a menu that is only rendered that way in one specific spot
 * it should be put into it's own file with the file syntax like:
 *
 *   _navigation-myspecialmenu
 *
 *
